					Rape is a heinous form of sexual assault that involves forcing penetration on another person without their consent. This violent act is a severe violation of human rights and leaves lasting physical, emotional, mental, and psychological scars on the victim. It often occurs when the victim is unable to resist or fight back, whether due to intoxication, unconsciousness, or the imbalance of strength between the perpetrator and the victim. Sadly, people of all ages, genders, and backgrounds—regardless of their environment, familial ties, or social status—can fall prey to this cruelty.
					Perpetrators of rape often argue that the victim consented to sexual activity, claiming the victim may not remember due to certain circumstances. However, this defense is invalid. True consent must be voluntary, informed, and given freely, without manipulation or pressure. A person who is intoxicated, unconscious, or mentally incapacitated cannot give clear and informed consent. It is crucial to understand that consent must come from a place of mental clarity and autonomy—anything less is not consent. Those who exploit such vulnerabilities and claim consent when the victim cannot reasonably provide it are guilty of sexual assault or rape.
					While the act of rape may be momentary, its effects endure far longer. Victims are often left with deep emotional and psychological trauma, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and trust issues. They may develop an overwhelming fear of people who resemble the perpetrator or experience isolation as they struggle to cope with their pain. Tragically, many victims never achieve justice, either due to lack of evidence, societal stigma, or personal fear of re-traumatization. It's vital that society acknowledges the long-term suffering of survivors and provides the support and justice they deserve.
